      <description>I am a polyglot programmer with 4.5 years&amp;rsquo; professional experience in designing and developing scalable microservices. I am interested in architecting and developing solutions for the cloud. I also have a keen interest in SRE(Site Reliability Engineering) practices.
I am experienced in building and maintaining enterprise level platform services. My project work includes developing an OAuth2 and SAML 2.0 compliant identity and access management system for a large German wholesaler, and a custom built ci/cd platform for one of Germany&amp;rsquo;s largest discount retailers.</description>
